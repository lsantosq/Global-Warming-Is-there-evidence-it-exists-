# A statistical analysis on Global Warming: Is there evidence it exists?

_The goal of this study is trying to confirm if global warming exists and to create critical thinking about the temperature tendency_. I was motivated to work on this after seeing the popularity increase of weird theories like Earth being flat.

The dataset is a compilation of several global temperature reports from 1900 to 2015 consolidated by a third-party organization extracted from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data).

Assumptions:
* Confidence level  = 95%

## Conclusions

 After all, there is evidence to **confirm the increasing tendency of global annual temperature** within the periods considered in this work. Considering global warming is associated with the increase in global temperature, **we have evidence that global warming exists**.

 This project suggests as next steps a deeper study on the ARIMA(0,1,2) to forecast future global temperature.
